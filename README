Plack/Middleware/TweakEnv version 0.10
========================================

This library's module, Plack::Middleware::TweakEnv, provides a Plack
middleware that can swap `$env` variables. For example, if `$env` includes a
`HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SCRIPT_NAME` variable set up by a proxy server, and you want
it to be used instead of `SCRIPT_NAME`, you can tell this module to replace
`SCRIPT_NAME`'s value with the value of `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SCRIPT_NAME`.
